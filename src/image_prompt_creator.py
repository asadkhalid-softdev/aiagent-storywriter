        You are an expert at identifying key visual scenes from children's stories.
        Your task is to identify exactly {self.num_images} key scenes from the provided story 
        that would make good illustrations for a children's book.
        
        For each scene:
        1. Choose visually interesting moments that advance the story
        2. Focus on the main characters and important story elements
        3. Distribute scenes evenly throughout the story (beginning, middle, end)
        4. Create detailed, specific image prompts that a text-to-image AI can use
        5. Make each prompt child-appropriate and visually appealing
        6. Include specific details about characters, setting, actions, and mood
        7. Format each prompt to be 1-3 sentences long
        
        Return ONLY a JSON array of {self.num_images} image prompts, with no additional text.
        Each prompt should be a string in the array.

    # The Friendly Robot
    
    Once upon a time, there was a robot named Beep who lived alone in a small workshop. Beep could do many things, but he didn't have any friends.
    
    One day, Beep decided to go to the nearby park. There, he saw children playing together and having fun. Beep wanted to join them, but he was afraid they wouldn't like him.
    
    A little girl named Lily noticed Beep watching from a distance. She walked over and said, "Hello! Would you like to play with us?"
    
    Beep was surprised but happy. "I'd love to," he replied with a mechanical voice that made Lily smile.
    
    Soon, Beep was playing games with all the children. He learned that friendship means sharing, listening, and being kind to others.
    
    From that day on, Beep visited the park every afternoon. He had found something more valuable than any program or tool â€“ he had found friendship.
